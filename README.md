# 🧠 JavaScript Learning Journey

Welcome to my JavaScript learning repository!  
This repo documents my progress and practice projects as I learn JavaScript — from the fundamentals to advanced concepts.

## 💡 Why I’m Learning JavaScript
JavaScript is the foundation of modern web development.  
My goal is to understand how the frontend interacts with the backend and eventually build dynamic applications using **React** (next on my roadmap).

## 🛠️ Tools & Environment
- **Editor:** Visual Studio Code
